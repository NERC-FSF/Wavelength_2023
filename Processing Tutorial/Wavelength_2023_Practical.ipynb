    "The first stage in any workflow in Python is to import the modules (which are collections of functions) that you will be using. In this analysis, we import a number of modules, the function of which is described in the comments (the light cyan text prefixed by the hash symbol). Note, modules must be installed first before use -- this can be handled by the conda package manager, or the pip package manager (please get in touch with us if you require help in setting this up). Here, the most important module to note is SpecDAL, a module designed to handle and process field spectroscopy data. To run the cell, press Shift and ENTER, or press Run in the ribbon above."

    "Depending on the spectrometer that you use, you may have to conduct 'overlap matching' and 'jump correction'. A typical field spectrometer covering the 350 nm to 2500 nm range consists of three spectrometers -- one covering the VNIR range (350 - 1000 nm), and two for the SWIR range (usually classed as SWIR-A, covering 1000 nm to 1800 nm, and SWIR-B, covering the 1800 nm to 2500 nm range. These spectrometers overlap in their ranges, leading to the zig-zags which you can see when plotting non-overlap corrected data. We can correct this using specdal's overlap stitching function, stitch, and then resolve 'jumps' in the subsequent data using the jump correction function, jump_correct.\n",
